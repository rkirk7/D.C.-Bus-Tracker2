# Washington, D.C. Bus Tracker

<h2>Description</h2>

This website was created as part of the MITxEmeritus course.

This website uses the Google Maps API and the Washington, D.C. transit API to enable the user to track buses on a selected route in real time.

<h2>How to Run</h2>

This project may be loaded in a browser. However, the user should replace the Google Maps API and the MATA API with their own APIs.

<h2>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h2>

I intend to continue developing the UI for this page. I'd like to make it more navigable. For example, I would like to label the individual markers with the bus IDs, and perhaps to add in the actual stop locations for the selected bus route.
